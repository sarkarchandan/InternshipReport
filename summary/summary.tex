\section{Summary}



\par In summary it has to be concluded that the status quo of beacons is not suited for mobility studies. Our experiment with the beacons showed that there are still shortcoming that have to be overcome before beacons can be reliable enough to use in a mobility study. 
We measured an approximate detection rate of 4\% which is far from reliable data. 
\par Though, factors causing this shortcomings are likely to change in future.  An improved detection rate of approximately 26\% is likely within the next few years. Still this prediction will not be accurate enough for a mobility study.
