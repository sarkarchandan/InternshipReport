\section{Reflection}
In this section I would like to reflect my views on the concepts that I have learned and the activities that I was engaged with. I would like to make it concise and to the point for three distinct areas that I have mentioned in the previous section.

\par I have learned the object oriented programing as part of my degree program and used the knowledge mostly in academic domain on delivering the assignment for various subjects of my curriculum. I had not prior experience on how to employ the object oriented methodology in a real world projects. Although I have theoretically studied the object oriented design patterns prior to starting my internship, I never before realized how to effectively use them in programming. Moreover, I have never realized how they make a difference between a usual code that accomplishes the task and a maintainable modular and cleaner code. At the start of my internship I have worked on various smaller practice projects without using any design strategy and after learning about the design patterns and I have recreated the same projects and clearly understood the impact of clean architecture and how they help software developers to maintain a code-base where they can easily integrate a new feature or deprecate some older ones without sacrificing existing capabilities of the code. For instance Favendo Commander framework is a careful orchestration of independent modules which interact with each other in order to create complete solution. Without a mediator design pattern implementation in the heart of this orchestration,  each module would have called functions of several other modules directly through respective interfaces. It would have accomplished the task but at the same time would have created dense interconnections bound to become unmanageable beyond certain point. By introducing mediator object in the middle we have achieved loose coupling and maintainability. We are now capable to add or deprecate a functionality without breaking existing once. Similarly using strategy design pattern made it easier for us to incorporate new algorithms to achieve a given task quickly and in much cleaner way.
