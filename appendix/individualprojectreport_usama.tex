\subsection{Individual Project Report for Usama Ahmed}
\par \underline{ECTS:} 9
\par \underline{Hours spent so far:} 270
\par \underline{Short description of the tasks done so far:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Integrating Beacons}
	\par I was responsible to integrate the beacon properly. For that I went through the content management system of Rakete7 to understand the working and redirection of the URL in Beacon. I also created the POIs in the content management system of Rakete7 and performed the testing on different devices.  
	\item \textbf{Questionnaire design and development}
	\par I created the 3 pages in HTML/CSS. I used the twitter bootstrap for the responsive design and for secure and easy further development I used Codeignitor framework to make the web pages. I also created the database in MYSQL and integrate it with the web pages. I also helped other group members to study the different technologies and divided tasks between them.
	\item \textbf{Problems and troubleshooting}
	\par In the phase of development when I try to test the web page in the beacon it shows me that it only takes https connection so because of that I created one page in the Rakete7 content management system and rest of 2 pages on our server.  While creating the page I also notice the bug of creating button in Rakete7 content management system which I also mentioned to them.
	\item \textbf{Putting the questionnaire Online}
	\par For the questionnaire to be available online i tried to set it up first on my personal server and then later decided to move it to the MOBI Server but did not get access to it.
	\item \textbf{ Converting the Questionnaire to a CMS}
	\par I proposed to change the questionnaire into a fully fledged CMS with New/edit/delete question options and designed the whole architecture for it. Discussed with other group members and helped them again to study the further technologies to make the CMS. Divided tasks among them to make them create some modules and explained the requirements to them. Created the Update Questions Modules and linked all the work one by others to make the CMS functional. Further tested it and removed the bugs.
	\item \textbf{Documentation and Meetings}
	\par Finally I documented the CMS completely. I also worked on the Project report and attended all the meetings with the Supervisors and the meetings with the other group members weekly to discuss and work on the tasks.
	\item \textbf{Teaching CI and Bootstrap}
	\par I also teach my group mates about the Codeignitor and Bootstarp . So they can also implement the code.
	\item \textbf{Meetings with Rekete 7}
	\par I also did meeting with Rekete7 with my group members . The purpose of those meetings are to understand more about Beacons and troubleshoot problems while integrating the POIS.
	\item \textbf{URL Security Study}
	\par I also study about the url security as there is a possibility of adding the javascript code in the url too and it can grab the cookies of the website and later perform redirect . Google stop such urls and also only consider the url with https in the be can url.
