\subsection{Individual Project Report for Chandan Sarkar}
\par \underline{ECTS:} 9
\par \underline{Hours spent so far:} 274
\par \underline{Short description of the tasks done so far:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tested Beacons after getting them for Rakete 7
	\item Prepared the initial version of the survey questionnaire and associated follow ups and discussions.
	\item Single handedly prepared the Sprint I presentation.
	\item Participated in Initial meeting task discussion (All Team Get Together  + Individual Team Get Together Meeting New members and individual task discussion) before Sprint II .
	\item Participated in discussion within team on the extra information needed from the Rakete 7 and how to achieve it.
	\item Participated in meeting With Rakete 7 for discussion on what is required for refined team goal after Sprint I and how far we can achieve it and how.
	\item Followed up with Rakete 7 on how to achieve the Api availability. This was multi stage work since the Api was not ready for use.
	\item Did brainstorming on the response from the Rakete 7 individual on Unique Detection.
	\item Discussed with the team on the issue like JWT and substance analytics Rakete 7 Substance Api call.
	\item Followed up with Rakete 7 on how to call this Api with JWT and associated challenges and issues with our Substance account.
	\item Discussed with Rakete 7 over uniqueness and own planning model the same.
	\item Did individual brainstorming on Unique Detection and planning the how to present the Unique detections in an acceptable way. whether it would be static report or the simulation of an Api that we can reuse. This was a single handed effort.
	\item Followed up with Rakete 7 on my findings and approach to the unique detection simulation model.
	\item Developed the model project Detection Approximation (REST-full API simulation of unique detection events and insights) with all the findings on the Unique Detection so far, with Java EE, Docker, PostgreSQL. This was a single handed effort.
	\item Studied on MAC addresses and how we can get the vendor specific information. Moreover what we could do with it. This was a single handed effort.
	\item Prepared own presentation for presenting my studies on MAC address and early findings of Unique Detection Approximation model. This was a single handed effort.
	\item Established the foundation and significant contribution in preparing the Project Report. It involves associated research and information hunting as well.
	\item Established the foundation and preparation and connecting things together for the final Project Presentation.
	\item Polished and further developing the unique detection Api simulation and prepare for the final project presentation.
	\item Finalized the final Presentation and planning presentation and last moment updates.
	\item Finalized Project Report post final presentation on the last phase by collecting necessary information, updates and revisions.
	\item Participated in all general team get together, status updates with the supervisor for all Sprints commencements.

\end{figure}
I have included few large chunks of hours in some of the tasks and responsibilities I have performed because those tasks not only took considerable time but also they were not continuous. They involved learning, troubleshooting, follow ups, error corrections, coordination with the team and presentation distributed over a large span of time. It is difficult for me to break them in further smaller hour slots. Apart from my individual tasks, I have laid the foundation and significantly contributed to the final project report and all project presentations.
