\section{Related Works}

In this section we would like to present information about some potential works that have been done to expand the frontier spear headed by the Physical Web and Internet of Things to create unique, useful and engaging services for the individual users and businesses. However, since Physical Web is a niche domain, momentary issues are also observed in beacon engagement. By the end of this document we would attempt to come up with relative arguments on both contexts.
